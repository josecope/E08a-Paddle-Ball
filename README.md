# E08a-Paddle-Ball
Hello!

In this exercise, I Created the beginnings of a brick-breaker game.  To do this, I created a ball and a paddle, and then defined collision areas so that the ball could continually bounce around.  Also, the paddle was programmed to be able to follow the mouse around so that the player of the game can move the paddle and hit the ball.

Thanks!
